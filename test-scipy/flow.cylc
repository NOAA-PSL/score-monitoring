# 
# Description:
# This Cylc workflow is a lightweight demonstration script designed to test
# that Cylc is correctly importing the required environment. It includes tasks
# that test the installation of numpy and scipy by running their respective
# test suites. These tests are executed on the default platform
# (e.g., background) and on the "batch_partition",
# which should be properly configured in the global.cylc configuration file.
# For more information on configuration, refer to:
# https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/reference/config/global.html
#
# ============================================================================
# Workflow Overview:
# - This suite imports numpy and scipy and runs the associated test suites
#   to verify the correct environment setup.
# - Tasks:
#   - test_numpy: Tests the numpy installation.
#   - test_scipy: Tests the scipy installation.
# - Execution:
#   - Tests run with a time limit of 6 hours.
#   - test_scipy runs on the "batch_partition", which needs to be configured
#     in the global configuration.
